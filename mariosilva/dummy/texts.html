    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>As part of an academic assignment to demonstrate the knowledge acquired during the Adobe InDesign layout course — provided through the FLAG training platform and taught by instructor Eduardo Antunes — students in the Graphic Design class were required to develop a project based on a magazine, following specific criteria and requirements.</p>
    <p>The theme of this project was left open to each student’s individual choice.</p>

    <h2>The Theme</h2>
    <p>Since I live in a rural area where vineyards are predominant — specifically in Palmela, a town well known for its wines — I chose to focus on the theme of local wines and wineries.</p>
    <p>After an initial research phase, I found enough information and text content to work with, particularly from the 18th Setúbal Peninsula Wine Competition:</p>

    <a href="https://vinhosdapeninsuladesetubal.org/noticias/sao-56-os-melhores-vinhos-da-peninsula-de-setubal/">https://vinhosdapeninsuladesetubal.org/noticias/sao-56-os-melhores-vinhos-da-peninsula-de-setubal/</a>

    <p>I also drew from the Rota dos Vinhos website, a local organization based in Palmela that introduces the public — in a single space — to the products of several wineries in the Setúbal District through wine tastings and wine tourism activities:</p>

    <a href="https://rotavinhospsetubal.com/adegas/">https://rotavinhospsetubal.com/adegas/</a>

    <p>With these resources, I was able to gather enough information about a substantial number of wineries in the region. The goal of the project was to showcase some of the wineries responsible for the award-winning wines featured in the 18th Setúbal Peninsula Wine Competition.</p>

    <h2>Target Audience</h2>
    <p>This project is aimed at a fairly specific audience, though two or three personas could be considered.</p>
    <p>It may be targeted at anyone who appreciates the subject — tourists or not — or at wine merchants, serving as a catalog supplement.</p>
    <p>The common thread is that these are adults, at least from a middle-class background, who — even though they “know what they’re looking for” — still wish to be pleasantly surprised.</p>
    <p>Therefore, I envisioned a visual identity for this project that is as sublime and simple as possible — striking a balance between solid graphic and design principles (albeit in a very amateur context), and a minimalist aesthetic that doesn't go overboard.</p>
