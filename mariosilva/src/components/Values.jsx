                <p>My process usually begins by understanding the core idea or challenge of a project.</p>
                <p>From there, I break it down into key stages:
                    research, structure, design, content, development, and testing.</p>
                <p>To stay focused and flexible, I organize and prioritize tasks using a hybrid approach — combining Scrum principles with the Eisenhower Matrix.</p>
                <p>I work in tight feedback loops, regularly presenting progress to clients or stakeholders to ensure alignment throughout. Each round informs the next — whether that means refining wireframes, adjusting layouts, or rethinking functionality.</p>
                <p>This loop continues until we reach a polished, functional result — or until the deadline calls for delivery.</p>
