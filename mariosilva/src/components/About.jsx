            <h2>Hello, my name is Mario</h2>
            <p>and I move quite comfortably across the fields of Graphic Design, UX/UI Design and Front-End Development, crafting solutions that blend aesthetics with function; I believe in delivering visual clarity and usability.</p>
            <p>I began working as a counter employee at a café after leaving school at 18 without completing my studies.</p>
            <p>In 2019, I made the decision to return to education and pursue my passions. Since then, I’ve completed multiple technical and creative courses — including Multimedia, Graphic Design, UX/UI Design, and currently, a Fullstack Developer program set to finish by the end of this year.</p>
            <p>This path has taught me resilience, adaptability, and a deep motivation to keep evolving.</p>
