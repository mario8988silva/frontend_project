The goal of the project was to showcase some of the wineries responsible for the award-winning wines featured in the 18th Setúbal Peninsula Wine Competition.</p>\n\n<h2>Target Audience</h2>\n<p>This project is aimed at a fairly specific audience, though two or three personas could be considered.</p>\n<p>It may be targeted at anyone who appreciates the subject — tourists or not — or at wine merchants, serving as a catalog supplement.</p>\n<p>The common thread is that these are adults, at least from a middle-class background, who — even though they “know what they’re looking for” — still wish to be pleasantly surprised.</p>\n<p>Therefore, I envisioned a visual identity for this project that is as sublime and simple as possible — striking a balance between solid graphic and design principles (albeit in a very amateur context), and a minimalist aesthetic that doesn't go overboard.</p>",
